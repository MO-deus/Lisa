	Entry point : from where to start the execution of the engine code.

	a DLL file contains an exports table. 
	The exports table contains the name of every function that the DLL exports to other executables.

	__declspec(export) : must be written before the calling convention keyword (like classes, struct etc.)
						 this enables the keyword to use those functions in the code however they see fit.


Monday, 14 Nov 2022, 0041 hours : Implementing logs ( for errors and messages )
	Logging : Writing log files/messages of various events
	-> assigning priority to messages, using color like red for errors, yellow for warnings etc.
	-> Using a library - [maybe] Easylogging++ or SPD log.

		-> Creating a wrapper (API for SPD logger)
	Issues : printing different types of data structures.
